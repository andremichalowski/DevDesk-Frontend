HOW TO CALCULATE WINDOW HEIGHT/MANIPULATE OFFSET Y TO MEET TABLE NEEDS

offsetY = totalPageLength - window.innerHeight.
if you have fixed elements like a fixed header and footer, add the length of the header 
(because it pushes the footer down) and footer (because its flexboxxed after everything else add its height)
as the minimum offset. if the total height is less than the minimum offset and screen height, 
you will still have a scrollbar but only to show the footer.

DevDesk/ViewAccount:
fixed = header footer and buttondiv-> 75+150+61(buttondiv can resize) -> 286
1287-286 = 1001

TableHeight = (ref1+ref2+ref3+ref4) + (ref1body+ref2body+ref3body+ref4body)
totalpixelheight = Header + ButtonDiv + TableHeight + Footer
ie -< 75 + 61 + 911 + 150 = 1197
1512-1197 = 315 (this is when table height passes the min and offsetY starts to increase.)

MINIMUM OFFSET Y IS 225.

if tablelength+fixed < 1512 (windowHeight+MINOFFSETY) 
-> offsety == 225 (fixed header of 75 + flexboxed appended footer of 150.)

else if table + fixed + 

if OFFSETY === 1287 + offset +- 75 + 150 + buttondiv + tablelength

goal is to get offset to equal tablebodylength?
goal is :: 1287 + offset === totalpixelsused + tablebody +- bullshitfactor
